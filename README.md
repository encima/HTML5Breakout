# HTML5 Breakout

## What it currently does:

* Ball hits paddle
* Ball bounces
* Ball breaks blocks
* Score updates
* Restarts on death
* Pauses
* Ball speeds up each time block breaks

## What it could do:

* Sound on each hit
* Scoreboard
* MUCH better collision detection
* Different block types
* Ball speeds up regardless of surface it hits

## Run me?

	npm install -g http-server
	http-server . (in root directory of project)
OR

Just open the HTML file in a browser.
