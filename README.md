# HTML5 Breakout

## Why do I have this?
This game is a (subjectively) ideal solution for creating an HTML5 game, all of the concepts that you need to know and apply to the Frogger game for your CM6111 coursework are in here.
If you use this as a resource, it must be referenced in the documentation for your submission.

## What it currently does:

* Ball hits paddle
* Ball bounces
* Ball breaks blocks
* Score updates
* Restarts on death
* Pauses
* Ball speeds up each time block breaks

## What it could do:

* Sound on each hit
* Scoreboard
* MUCH better collision detection
* Different block types
* Ball speeds up regardless of surface it hits

## Run me?

	npm install -g http-server
	http-server . (in root directory of project)
OR

Just open the HTML file in a browser.
